## Overview

**WOFARES** - **W**orld **OF** squ**ARES** is a platformer game engine innovatively designed around the concept of level destruction. It features a unique mechanism where tiles shatter into pieces, with fragments dispersing realistically thanks to the integration of the Box2D physics engine. This game engine is envisioned to support hot seat gameplay and single-player mode.

At the core of WOFARES's engine lies a robust foundation constructed using C++ and leveraging libraries such as SDL, EnTT, gml, imgui, and Box2D. A pivotal aspect of the game's design is the extensive application of the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern. This architectural approach significantly reduces component coupling and simplifies engine maintenance, ensuring a seamless and immersive gaming experience.

Here is a link to the game created with this engine for [LD55](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/ld55-hungry-portals) championship: [Hungry Portals (Web/Desktop)](https://marleeeeeey.itch.io/ld55-hungry-portals). Source code for the game is available [here](https://github.com/marleeeeeey/LD55_Hungry_Portals).

## Guidelines

### Development Guidelines

#### Efficient Component Access (Entt library)

- **Use of Views**: When you need to iterate over entities that share a common set of components, prefer using `view` over `all_of` or `any_of` checks within loop iterations. Views are optimized for fast access and iteration, as they precompute and cache the entities that match the specified component criteria. This approach significantly reduces overhead and improves performance, especially with large entity sets.

```cpp
  // Recommended
  auto view = registry.view<ComponentA, ComponentB>();
  for (auto entity : view) {
      // Process entities that have both ComponentA and ComponentB
  }
```

- **Avoid Frequent Component Checks**: Using `registry.all_of` or `registry.any_of` in tight loops for large numbers of entities can be inefficient. These functions check each entity's component makeup at runtime, which can lead to performance degradation if used improperly. (TODO2: check the game code for this).

```cpp
  // Not recommended for large sets or frequent updates
  for (auto entity : registry) {
      if (registry.all_of<ComponentA, ComponentB>(entity)) {
          // Process entity
      }
  }
```

- **Entity Processing Recommendations**: If specific conditional checks on entity components are necessary outside of views, consider structuring your logic to minimize the frequency and scope of these checks, or use architectural patterns that naturally segregate entities into manageable sets. (TODO2: thinking about splitting entities into more specific components).

#### Object Factory

- **ObjectsFactory** is the only object that should add new components to the `entt::registry`.
  - Any method that creates a new object must start with `Spawn`.

#### Component Naming Conventions

- Class names for components must end with `Component`.
  - Header files containing components should end with `_components.h`.

#### Coordinate Systems and Object Sizing

- Texture sizes are measured in pixels, while the sizes of objects in the physical world are measured in meters.
- There are three coordinate systems: screen, pixel world, and physical world. Variable names should end with `Screen`, `World` (TODO3: rename to `Pixels`), or `Physics`.

#### C++ Style Guide

- Prefer using `enum class` over boolean variables.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Use descriptive and clear naming conventions that reflect the purpose and usage of the variable or function.

#### Configuration Style Guide

- In `config.json`, section names should correspond to the class names that use them.
- Variable naming in `config.json` should be a direct copy of the variable names in the code.
- Debug options should start with `debug` and may be located in every section.

#### Animation Editor and Engine Integration

- The player animation stores the BBox (bounding box) of the object used for collision detection.
- Bullet animations should not consider the dimensions of the BBox for speed calculations.

### Assets Editing Guidelines

#### Aseprite Guidelines

- **Tagging**: Ensure that all frames are tagged, as these tags are referenced in the C++ code for animation handling.
- **Hitbox Frame**: Include a specifically named frame `Hitbox` within your Aseprite files, which will be used to define interaction boundaries in the game.

#### Tiled Map Editor Guidelines

- **Layer Structure**: Your maps should be organized with the following layers from bottom to top:
  - `background`: For non-interactive scenery that appears behind all game entities.
  - `interiors`: For elements like indoor furnishings that players can potentially interact with but are not part of the terrain.
  - `terrain`: For the main walkable and interactive layer of the game environment.
  - `objects`: For movable or interactive objects that players can interact with during the game.

### Comments

- **Code Block Comments**: Surround the comments for a block of code with repeating // or # symbols depending on the programming language. This practice helps in maintaining visibility of the block's purpose when code folding is enabled in the editor.

```js

# #################### Setup compiler options #######################

```

## Build

Wofares Game Engine has been developed, built, and tested on **Windows** and **Web(Emscripten)**. Build also works on **Linux(Ubuntu)** but not tested yet.

### Windows build

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/marleeeeeey/wofares-game-engine.git
```

#### Prerequisites for Building the Project (Windows)

- CMake.
- Ninja.
- Clang compiler (other compilers may work, but are not officially supported).
- Git (to load submodules).
- Visual Studio Code (recommended for development).
  - Clangd extension (recommended for code analysis).
- Python and 7zip (for packaging game to achive).

#### Build, run and debug via VSCode tasks (Windows)

- Setup user friendly options via editing file [scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py](scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py).
- Run the script [scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py](scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py) to generate VSCode tasks with your options.
- Open the project folder in VSCode.
- Run task: `003. Install vcpkg as subfolder`.
- Run task: `050. + Run`.
- For debugging press `F5`.

#### Build, run and debug manually (Windows)

To build Wofares Game Engine on Windows, it's recommended to obtain the dependencies by using vcpkg. The following instructions assume that you will follow the vcpkg recommendations and install vcpkg as a subfolder. If you want to use "classic mode" or install vcpkg somewhere else, you're on your own.

This project define it's dependences:
1. In a `vcpkg.json` file, and you are pulling in vcpkg's cmake toolchain file.
2. As git submodules in the `thirdparty` directory. Because some of the libraries not available in vcpkg or have an error in the vcpkg port file.

First, we bootstrap a project-specific installation of vcpkg ("manifest mode") in the default location, `<project root>/vcpkg`. From the project root, run these commands:

```bash
cd wofares_game_engine
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

Now we ask vcpkg to install of the dependencies for our project, which are described by the file `<project root>/vcpkg.json`.  Note that this step is optional, as cmake will automatically do this.  But here we are doing it in a separate step so that we can isolate any problems, because if problems happen here don't have anything to do with your cmake files.

```bash
.\vcpkg\vcpkg install --triplet=x64-windows
```

Next build the project files. There are different options for
1. Telling cmake how to integrate with vcpkg: here we use `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` on the command line.
2. Select Ninja project generator.
3. Select Clang compiler.
4. Enable `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` to generate a `compile_commands.json` file for clangd.

```
cmake -S . -B build -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
cd build
cmake --build .
```

Finally, we copy the assets and configuration file to the build directory.

```bash
cmake -E copy ../config.json ./src/config.json
cmake -E copy_directory ../assets ./src/assets
```

Run the game:

```bash
src\wofares_game_engine.exe
```

### Linux build

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/marleeeeeey/wofares_game_engine.git
```

#### Prerequisites for Building the Project (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install python3 clang ninja-build curl zip unzip tar autoconf automake libtool python3-pip cmake
pip install jinja2
```

#### Build, run and debug via VSCode tasks (Linux)

- Setup user friendly options via editing file [scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py](scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py).
- Run the script [scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py](scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py) to generate VSCode tasks with your options.
- Open the project folder in VSCode.
- Run task: `003. Install vcpkg as subfolder`.
- Run task: `050. + Run`.
- For debugging press `F5`.

#### Build, run and debug manually (Linux)

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg && ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh && ./vcpkg/vcpkg install --triplet=x64-linux
cmake -S . -B build -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
cmake --build build/debug -- -k 0
cmake -E copy config.json build/debug/src/config.json
cmake -E copy_directory assets build/debug/src/assets
./build/debug/src/wofares_game_engine
```

### Web build

#### Prerequisites for Building the Project (Web)

- Emscripten SDK additionally to [Windows build prerequisites](#prerequisites-for-building-the-project-windows).

#### Build, run and debug via VSCode tasks (Web)

- Set `self.build_for_web = BuildForWeb.YES` and other WebRelated options in [scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py](scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py). Example below:

```python

class WebBuildSettings:
    def __init__(self):
        self.build_for_web = BuildForWeb.YES
        self.emsdk_path = "C:/dev/emsdk"
        self.compiler = "emcc"
        self.path_to_ninja = "C:/dev/in_system_path/ninja.exe"  # Fix issue: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "Ninja".  CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set.

```

- Run the script [scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py](scripts/vscode_tasks_generator.py) to generate VSCode tasks with your options.
- Open the project folder in VSCode.
- Run task: `003. Install vcpkg as subfolder`.
