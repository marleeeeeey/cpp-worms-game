# WOFARES (C++ Game Project)

**WOFARES** - **W**orld **OF** squ**ARES** is a platformer game innovatively designed around the concept of level destruction. It features a unique mechanism where tiles shatter into pieces, with fragments dispersing realistically thanks to the integration of the Box2D physics engine. This game is envisioned to support cooperative multiplayer gameplay and single-player mode.

At the core of WOFARES's engine lies a robust foundation constructed using C++ and leveraging libraries such as SDL, EnTT, gml, imgui, and Box2D. A pivotal aspect of the game's design is the extensive application of the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern. This architectural approach significantly reduces component coupling and simplifies engine maintenance, ensuring a seamless and immersive gaming experience.

### Platform Support

- This game has been developed, built, and tested solely on **Windows**. While cross-platform libraries suggest the potential for broader compatibility, official support for platforms other than Windows is not currently offered.

### Prerequisites for Building the Project

- CMake.
- Ninja.
- Clang compiler (other compilers may work, but are not officially supported).
- Git (to load submodules).
- Visual Studio Code (recommended for development).
  - Clangd extension (recommended for code analysis). Project is configured to generate `compile_commands.json` for Clangd.

### Installing dependencies (Windows)

```
vcpkg install sdl2-mixer asio
```

### Build and run from Visual Studio Code

- `git clone --recursive https://github.com/marleeeeeey/wofares-game.git` to clone the repository and its submodules.
- Open the project folder in VSCode.
- Press `F5` to build and run the game. This action triggers the CMake configuration, project build, copy assets and game launch.

### Build and run from console

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/marleeeeeey/wofares-game.git
cd wofares-game
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Ninja" DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -B . -S ..
cmake --build .
cmake -E copy ../config.json ./src/config.json
cmake -E copy_directory ../thirdparty/game_assets/wofares/assets ./src/assets
src/wofares.exe
```
